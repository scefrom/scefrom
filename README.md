## Scefrom

Hi! My name is Pietro, i live in Italy and im 15 years old.

I started my programing career in Roblox, making some projects using Lua. Then i wanted to escape the platform, and i started learning the C programming language by its own book, after learning how the cpu and memory work togheter.

### Calk

I became appassionate of low-level programming and i started making a CLI expression-based calculator in C: Calk, that i still use today. (private repository, planning to revamp it, since it was my first project and i didnt have much knowledge).

### Cnes

Months later i decided to start another project: an SDL2-based NES emulator in C: Cnes (still, private repository, planning to add more things before making it public). Its 6502 cpu emulator doesnt respect clock cycles and its pretty simple, but can pass the 6502 functionality program developed by Klaus2m5 (https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests/blob/master/6502_functional_test.a65)

### Bridge

By the end of April 2022, i started taking another project more seriously: Bridge, a javascript-like syntax programming language that compiles into assembly-like bytecode.
The project owner is @CristianoBarone, in fact he owns the repository (guess what? private, lol).
This is the project im currently working to almost everyday. We hope the first version to come soon, in order to make the repository public bringing Bridge to life!
